 # Stock-Market-Kafka-Real-Time-Data-Analysis
 ## Introduction
 
In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.
We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Technology Used
- Programming Language - Python
- Amazon Web Service (AWS)
  - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
  - Athena
  - Glue Crawler
  - Glue Catalog
  - EC2
- Apache Kafka

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

    - An AWS account with permissions for EC2, S3, Glue, and Athena.
    - Python 3.x installed locally.
    - Apache Kafka installed on EC2 instances.
    - Basic knowledge of Kafka, AWS services, and SQL.
    
## Dataset Used
You can use any dataset, we are mainly interested in operation side of Data Engineering (building data pipeline)
Here is the dataset used in the project - https://github.com/NouhaylaChataoui/Stock-Market-Kafka-Real-Time-Data-Analysis/blob/main/indexProcessed.csv

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining Apache Kafka with AWS services to build a scalable and real-time data processing pipeline. By leveraging cloud infrastructure, it becomes easier to manage, process, and analyze large datasets with minimal overhead.
